# 🤖 AI Model Data Training (Built with Chatbase)

## 🧩 Overview
This project is a hands-on experiment in building and training an AI chatbot using **[Chatbase](https://www.chatbase.co)**.  
The goal was to create a bot that feels natural to talk to, can answer real questions, and even pull in live information from the web.

The chatbot is embedded into a simple webpage using an HTML `<iframe>` — just like you’d see on modern websites.  
It can also connect to external APIs (like **GNews**, i couldnt get it to work..) to share live news updates, making it both interactive and informative.
